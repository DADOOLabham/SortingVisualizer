# SortingVisualizer
A sorting visualizer is a tool or application that graphically demonstrates how different sorting algorithms arrange data. It visually represents the process of sorting a list or array of elements (typically numbers) by displaying each step of the algorithm. This is useful for educational purposes, as it helps users understand how sorting algorithms work by providing an intuitive, visual approach to algorithm behavior.

Algorithm Selection: The user can choose from various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, etc. Each algorithm has a unique way of sorting the elements, which is demonstrated by the visualizer.

Visualization Process: As the algorithm progresses, the visualizer shows the movement of elements. Swaps, comparisons, and key steps are highlighted to demonstrate the inner workings of the algorithm.
